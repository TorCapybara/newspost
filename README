Just type 'make' then 'make install' to install to /usr/local/bin.
Use 'make -f Makefile.solaris' if you are running that OS.

If you want it installed to a different directory, type
'make install BINDIR=/yourdir/bin/'.

type "newspost -h" to see available options.

Newspost has only been tested on linux and solaris, but a
simple change in the Makefile will make it compile on other
unixes.  Success/failure stories are welcome.
