Just type 'make' then 'make install' to install to /usr/local/bin.

If you want it installed to a different directory, type
'make install BINDIR=/yourdir/bin/'.

It only works in linux right now, but support for most unixes
is intended in future releases.  Though it may appear to compile
and post on other unixes, it might not work correctly.

type "newspost -h" to see available options.
