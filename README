INSTALLATION

Just type 'make' then 'make install' to install to /usr/local/bin.
If you want it installed to a different directory, type
'make install BINDIR=/yourdir/bin/'.

If you are not running Linux, then use 'make -f Makefile.YOUR_OS' 
if you are running YOUR_OS.  I only have makefiles for linux, solaris
and OSF (DEC Alpha) right now, but other UNIX variants should only 
require small changes.

If you want it installed to a different directory, type
'make install BINDIR=/yourdir/bin/'.

USAGE

type "newspost -h" to see available options and a couple examples.

NOTE

Newspost automatically appends the name of the binary attachment 
you are posting and which part of that file your are posting.
For example, if you use the commandline

$ newpost -s "This is my favorite album" *.mp3

The subject lines posted would be:

This is my favorite album - Track01.mp3 (1/2)
This is my favorite album - Track01.mp3 (2/2)
This is my favorite album - Track02.mp3 (01/17)
This is my favorite album - Track02.mp3 (02/17)
This is my favorite album - Track02.mp3 (03/17)
etc...

Nothing is appended to the subject line when the -t option is used.

FEEDBACK

Feedback is welcome, but patches are more welcome, as well as
makefiles for different OSes.  Please report any bugs you find.
